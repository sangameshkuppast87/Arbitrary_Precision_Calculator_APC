# Arbitrary_Precision_Calculator_APC
A C-based Arbitrary Precision Calculator that performs arithmetic operations on very large numbers which cannot be handled by standard data types. This project is implemented using linked lists to store and manipulate numbers digit by digit.



## 📌 Features

- Supports **large integers of arbitrary length**
- Operations implemented:
  - ➕ Addition
  - ➖ Subtraction
  - ✖️ Multiplication
  - ➗ Division
- Modular design with separate source files for each operation
- Command-line based execution
- Efficient memory management using dynamic allocation

```
## 🧪 Usage

The program accepts operands and operator as **command-line arguments**.

### General Usage
```bash
./a.out <number1> <operator> <number2>
```

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Linked Lists
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Pointers
- Modular Programming in C
